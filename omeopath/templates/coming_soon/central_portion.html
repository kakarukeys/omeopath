            <h2>Support Us</h2>
            <p>Support our cause by donating to us and receive an e-book <strong>50 Things About GERD Your Doctor Did Not Tell You</strong> written by our researchers. The book provides facts that people are not often aware of about GERD. Based on medical sources and personal experience, it will help a patient better manage the disease. The proceeds will be spent on paying our designers and developers, and keeping our servers running, while we look for a grant.</p>
